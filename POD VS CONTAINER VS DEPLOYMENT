 - **Pod**: A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing one or more containers that share resources like networking and storage.
            Containers within a Pod are scheduled and run together on the same worker node. 
            Pods are ephemeral by nature and can be replaced and rescheduled by Kubernetes controllers.

- **Container**: A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and its dependencies so the application can run quickly and reliably across different computing environments. 
                  In the context of Kubernetes, containers run within Pods and represent the individual application components.

- **Deployment**: A Deployment is a Kubernetes resource used to manage the lifecycle of Pods and ReplicaSets.
                  Deployments enable the declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets, providing features like rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling. 
                  Deployments abstract the underlying complexity of managing Pods and ReplicaSets, making it easier to define, manage, and scale applications in Kubernetes.
