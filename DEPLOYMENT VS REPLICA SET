 - **Deployment**: A Deployment in Kubernetes provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
                  It allows you to define the desired state of the application, handles creating and updating ReplicaSets to meet that state, enables rolling updates, and supports rollback capabilities. 
                  Deployments are primarily focused on managing application lifecycle, scalability, and availability.

- **ReplicaSet**: A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of replica Pods are running at any given time. 
                  It is used to maintain a stable set of replica Pods, scaling them up or down as needed. 
                  ReplicaSets are lower-level controllers compared to Deployments and are often created by Deployments to manage the replication of Pods. 
                  While ReplicaSets ensure a desired number of Pods are running, Deployments manage the overall application state and updates.
